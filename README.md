# Teli-Tracker
A lightweight tool for capturing vendor interactions so sourcing decisions compound instead of resetting
___

Search for a vendor, request pricing, wait for replies, compare options, make a decision and then, a month later, there’s nothing to show for it except a receipt and whatever one person remembers (if they’re still around).

The reasoning behind vendor choices often disappears into emails, shared drives, or someone’s head. When that person leaves, a library of knowledge leaves with them lost in the corporate abyss.

Teli-Tracker exists to fight that.

Too often, companies build months or years of internal process, vendor relationships, and sourcing knowledge, only to lose pieces of it through normal turnover. What was learned gets reset, and the same work gets repeated.

This small, lightweight application is meant to preserve that knowledge and allow it to grow over time.

The idea is simple. Individual data points may not seem valuable on their own, but accumulated over time, they tell a story. One vendor interaction is forgettable. Hundreds of them create patterns, who is consistently reliable, who ships fast, who offers the best pricing, and who is worth calling first.

Instead of losing past knowledge, Teli-Tracker helps you build on top of it.
